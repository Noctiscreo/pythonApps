# pythonApps
A sample of small Python apps I've tinkered with.

The .py files are all part of my portfolio submission I made to a bootcamp I took part in late in 2021.
The first week of the course was based mainly on Python lecture material followed by daily coding exercises.
At the end of the module we were given coding tasks to do. Most of the sample code submitted here was done independently. 

There is a 'portfolio4_honours_1.py' file and another 'portfolio4_honours_2.py' file.
The 'portfolio4_honours_2.py' file is an amended version of my 'portfolio4_honours_1.py' code where my mentor helped me to wrap it all in functions.
I never fully understood how she did this at the time and never got a chance to follow up on it.

I have included two word docs: 'John_Hasznosi_Python-Portfolio.docx' and 'Portfolio_Feedback -John_Hasznosi.docx'

These Word docs contain the Python section of my portfolio submssion to the bootcamp as well as the feedback I received for it.
